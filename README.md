# ETL CLI on Rust

A simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) CLI tool written in Rust**.

This repo is focused on building a fast, predictable, and resource-efficient data processing pipeline.

## Why Rust?

ETL workloads often involve **terabytes of data** that need to be processed efficiently and reliably. Rust is a good fit because it offers:

* High performance
* Predictable memory usage
* Explicit and reliable error handling
* Low runtime overhead, which matters in cloud environments where memory and compute cost money

The goal is to keep the implementation simple, explicit, and efficient.
